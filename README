This package contains a pickle and utils for working with TeleDisk's TD0 format
images using GNU poke.

It was created using the Teledisk Image File Format Notes by Dave Dunfield [1].

Installation
============

In order to use these tools you will need GNU poke 1.2. You can just run them
from the source directory or you can use the following command under super
user to install them system-wide (tune PREFIX value, default is /usr/local):

  $ make PREFIX=/usr install

Known issues
============

td02ima works painfully slow. It takes about 10 seconds to convert 720K image
on a recent hardware. Contact me if you know what is wrong with it.
